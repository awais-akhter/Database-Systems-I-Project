### Dairy Farm Management System Database (Schema & Queries) on Microsoft SQL Studio

A dairy farm sells milk and meat of different animals. Each animal has a unique tag number and a different species, i.e., cow, buffalo or sheep etc. These animals can either be bought or born in farm. Each animal is assigned a specific food group, they are fed according to the food groups. Admin will enter record of animal such as tag number, sex, kind, color, born date, calving date, parent tag number, food group and no. of treatments.
The farm buys different types of forage, supplements, and medicines which are used for better development of animals. Each of these items have different types, a specific measuring unit and price which is associated to them. Price is calculated w.r.t unit of item. Food groups basically contains a mixture of ingredients (forage + supplements) in a specific unit ratio (weight).
Medicines are used to artificially inseminate for reproduction or to give some type of treatment. If an animal becomes ill then treatment is provided to it and this record is stored. 
The animal may give birth to new animals whose record is managed by their reproduction cycle. Admin will keep the record of each reproduction which contains animal tag, dry date, on heat date, insemination date, delivery date and medicine used. 
All the expense of bought and used items including miscellaneous charges are stored for profit/loss calculations.  The produced items milk and meat are sold at different prices whose record is kept by their sales. At the end the total expense of the farm is subtracted from the total sales to generate profit report on daily, weekly or monthly bases.
